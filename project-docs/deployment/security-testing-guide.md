# Security Testing and Production Readiness Guide

This guide outlines the security testing procedures and production readiness checks for the Creator Promotion Platform.

## Security Testing

### Authentication and Authorization Testing

Authentication and authorization security tests verify that:

- User authentication is secure and properly implemented
- Session management follows security best practices
- Role-based access control works correctly
- CSRF protection is in place
- Password policies are enforced

Run the authentication security tests:

```bash
cd apps/auth-app
npm run test:security
```

### API Penetration Testing

API penetration tests check for common vulnerabilities:

- SQL Injection
- NoSQL Injection
- Path Traversal
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Broken Access Control
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Rate Limiting

Run the API penetration tests:

```bash
cd apps/dashboard-app
npm run test:security
```

### Disaster Recovery Testing

Disaster recovery tests verify the system's ability to recover from failures:

- Database backup and restore
- Redis persistence and recovery
- Connection pool resilience
- Failover mechanisms

Run the disaster recovery tests:

```bash
npm run test:disaster-recovery
```

## Production Readiness Checks

### Final Deployment Testing

The production deployment test script verifies that all components are working correctly in a production-like environment:

- All services are running
- Database and Redis connections are working
- Critical API endpoints are accessible
- Domain configurations are correct
- SSL certificates are valid
- Load balancing is working (if applicable)

Run the production deployment test:

```bash
npm run test:production
```

### Pre-Production Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - All required environment variables are set
   - No development credentials in production
   - Secrets are properly managed

2. **Database**
   - Migrations are tested
   - Indexes are optimized
   - Backup strategy is in place

3. **Security**
   - HTTPS is enforced
   - Content Security Policy is configured
   - Rate limiting is in place
   - Authentication is secure

4. **Monitoring**
   - Logging is configured
   - Error tracking is set up
   - Performance monitoring is in place
   - Alerts are configured

5. **Scalability**
   - Connection pooling is configured
   - Caching strategy is implemented
   - Load testing has been performed

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication

- Use secure HTTP-only cookies for session management
- Implement CSRF protection
- Enforce strong password policies
- Use proper token expiration
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts

### API Security

- Validate all input
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper access control
- Avoid exposing sensitive data
- Use rate limiting for API endpoints

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use HTTPS for all connections
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly audit data access

### Infrastructure Security

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use secure configurations
- Implement proper network security
- Regularly update and patch systems
- Use secure deployment practices

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Identify and Isolate**
   - Identify the affected systems
   - Isolate affected components

2. **Analyze and Mitigate**
   - Analyze the incident
   - Implement immediate mitigations

3. **Recover and Report**
   - Restore systems to normal operation
   - Report the incident to stakeholders

4. **Learn and Improve**
   - Conduct a post-incident review
   - Implement improvements to prevent similar incidents
